## Project Title: Fresher's Heist

### Overview
Freshers' MarketPlace is a user-friendly online platform that facilitates direct communication between seniors and freshers for buying and selling various items, including ED kits, bicycles, manufacturing coats, and more.

### Video Demonstration

### Problem Statement
Freshers face difficulties when trying to contact seniors for purchasing items. The existing process involves saving contacts from an Excel sheet, then reaching out via WhatsApp. This process has several issues such as outdated lists, incomplete information, lack of images, and payment challenges.

### Solution
Our solution is a streamlined approach with direct WhatsApp links and real-time item updates.

#### Direct WhatsApp Links
We provide direct WhatsApp chat links for each senior. Freshers can instantly connect with seniors without saving contacts separately. This eliminates the need for manual contact saving and enables immediate communication.

#### Dynamic Item List
We maintain an online platform where seniors upload items with descriptions, images, and prices. Seniors can add or remove items as needed. When a junior logs in, they confirm whether their last contact was successful. If so, the item is removed from the list. Each item includes a brief description, images, and pricing. This ensures freshers see the latest available items, helps them make informed decisions, and reduces payment challenges.

### Dark Mode
The platform also supports a dark mode feature to provide a comfortable viewing experience for users in low-light environments.
